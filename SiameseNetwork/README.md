# One-shot Learning in Keras

This project has been adapted from [here](https://github.com/sorenbouma/keras-oneshot).

[Koch et al, Siamese Networks for one-shot learning,](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf) reimplimented in keras.
Trains on the [Omniglot dataset]( https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot).


## Training

First, download source code and generate data samples using [DataGeneration](../DataGeneration)

```bash
python train_net.py

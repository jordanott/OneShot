# One-shot learning on source code

## [DataGeneration](https://github.com/jordanott/OneShot/tree/master/DataGeneration)
This is an older directory, used to generate images with different types of programming language code in them. There's 15 different options of languages (Python, Java, C, etc.). This was used to test one-shot learning. Never worked super well.

## [SiameseNetwork](https://github.com/jordanott/OneShot/tree/master/SiameseNetwork)
This has the models for shallow, vgg, and siamese networks along with training and plotting cam results
